# Cub3D
A graphic design project of 42 school curriculum, inspired by the world famous game of the 90's, Wolfenstein 3D.

The project is designed to explore the technique of ray-casting in a three-dimensional gaming environment. The program allows the parsing of a scene description file (with a .cub extension), the rendering of a three-dimensional view from the player's perspective (akin to a first-person shooter), the handling of basic user input (WASD to move, ESC to exit), and the implementation of simple collision detection.

The project is written in C and utilises the [MLX42 graphic library by Codam](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42). This project can be considered an introduction to the fundamentals of game development, computer graphics, and, more generally, 3D rendering.
